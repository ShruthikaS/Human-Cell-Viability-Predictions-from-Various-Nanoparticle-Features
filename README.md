Nanoparticles cause protein binding, oxidative stress, autophagy, inflammation, cellular uptake, and apoptosis (Sun et al., 2019). With an estimated 75 NPs being used for biomedical applications and an additional 100 currently being clinically tested, NPs are becoming significantly more applicable in the biomedical field (Bharathala & Sharma, 2019). Recent studies have found the most important determinants of cell viability from NPs to be the nanoparticle shape, size, surface charge, synthesis method, and cell type (Gul et al., 2021). Although many studies have assessed the specific impact of NPs on certain cell lines, few have used machine learning to predict cell viability. Current machine learning tools do not effectively manage missing values in datasets. Therefore, this research aims to create a random forest algorithm (RF) to predict human cell viability after nanoparticle application. The accuracy of the model will be determined through in vitro validation with the A549 human lung carcinoma cell line and the HCMEC/D3 human blood brain barrier (BBB) cell line.  This novel research is important for nanotechnologists, researchers, and nanomaterial manufacturers to determine nanoparticle cytotoxicity for human cells through a general model.
